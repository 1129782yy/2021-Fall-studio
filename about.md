The American Institute of Architects Utah Chapter (AIA Utah) and the Community Development Corporation of Utah (CDCU), in collaboration with Salt Lake City Corporation (SLC or City), known together herein afterward as Competition Organizers (Organizers), invite people to share their innovation, creativity, and vision by designing a small residential structure or "Tiny Home." The design may be a standalone home, a cluster of small cottages in a planned development, or ar Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) on a lot with a primary residence.  This competition is an opportunity for architects, emerging professionals, residential designers, design students, and others to have a direct impact in providing solutions to Salt Lake City's affordable housing shortage.
Here I will show the progress record of the my project about the competition.At the same time, this is also a record of my 2021-Fall studio.
